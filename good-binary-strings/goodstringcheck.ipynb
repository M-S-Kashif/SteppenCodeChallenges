For example, *01011*, *1111*, and *00* are all binary strings.\n","- The *prefix* of a string is any substring of the string that includes the beginning of the string. For example, the prefixes of *11010* are *1*, *11*, *110*, *1101*, and *11010*.\n","\n","A non-empty binary string is *good* if the following two conditions are true:\n","\n","1. The number of *0*'s is equal to the number of *1*'s.\n","2. For every prefix of the binary string, the number of *1*'s isn’t less than the number of *0*'s.\n","\n","For example, *11010* is not good because it doesn't have an equal number of *0*'s and *1*'s, but *110010* is good because it satisfies both of the above conditions.\n","\n","A good string can contain multiple good substrings. Substrings are consecutive if the last character of the first substring occurs exactly one index before the first character of the second substring. If two *consecutive substrings* are good, then we can *swap* the substrings as long as the resulting string is still a good string."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Checking ones and zeroes in a Binary String...\n","def check_zeros_ones(binString):\n","    zeros = 0\n","    ones = 0\n","\n","    for char in binString:\n","      if char == '0':\n","        zeros += 1\n","      elif char == '1':\n","        ones += 1\n","      elif char != '1' or char != '0':\n","        raise ValueError(\"Invalid character in binary string.\")\n","\n","    return zeros, ones"],"metadata":{"id":"gjaTKb4WT3dy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708829765891,"user_tz":-660,"elapsed":32,"user":{"displayName":"Sohaib Kashif","userId":"14053195997263092549"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Creating a function for checking good Binary Strings...\n","from logging import error\n","\n","def checkBinString(binString):\n","\n","  #First Check: Checking if the Binary is even in length...\n","  lenStr = len(binString)\n","  if lenStr % 2 == 0:\n","\n","    #Second Check: Ensure that there is no other characters in the binary string other than zeros and ones...\n","    num_zeros = 0\n","    num_ones = 0\n","    num_zeros, num_ones = check_zeros_ones(binString)\n","\n","    #Third Check: Ensuring the First Condition; The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's...\n","    if (num_zeros == num_ones):\n","      print(\"First Condition Satisified!\")\n","    else:\n","      raise ValueError(\"Unequal number of zeroes and ones in the binary string!\")\n","\n","    #Fourth Check: Checking that all the prefixes of the Binary String meet the second condition...\n","    for idx in range(1,len(binstring)):\n","      num_zeros = 0\n","      num_ones = 0\n","      prefix = binstring[:idx]\n","      #last_part = string[idx:]\n","      #print(idx, first_part, last_part)\n","      num_zeros, num_ones = check_zeros_ones(prefix)\n","      if (num_ones < num_zeros):\n","        raise ValueError(\"Second Condition hasn't been reached; More zeroes than ones in the last prefix!\")\n","\n","    print(\"All conditions and checks Passed. {} is a Binary String! \\n\\n\".format(binString))\n","\n","  else:\n","    raise ValueError(\"Binary Sting is Odd numbered!\")"],"metadata":{"id":"CauEkl5AKxr5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708829765891,"user_tz":-660,"elapsed":31,"user":{"displayName":"Sohaib Kashif","userId":"14053195997263092549"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RZk9AMN9I_oJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708829765892,"user_tz":-660,"elapsed":31,"user":{"displayName":"Sohaib Kashif","userId":"14053195997263092549"}},"outputId":"f462ea39-72c7-48b3-c5bc-3eaaea21bd83"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["First Condition Satisified!\n","All conditions and checks Passed. 111000 is a Binary String! \n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["binstring = \"111000\"\n","checkBinString(binstring)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UG51ARmJI_oJ"},"source":["**Task**\n","\n","Use whatever language you like; even pseudocode is fine.\n","\n","- Given a good binary string, `binString`, perform zero or more swap operations on its consecutive good substrings such that the resulting string represents as large an integer (in base 10) as possible.\n","\n","For example, if we look at the good binary string *1010111000*, we see two good binary substrings, *1010* and *111000* among others.
